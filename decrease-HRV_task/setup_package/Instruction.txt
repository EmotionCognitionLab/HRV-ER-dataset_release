
1. Allow script execution
1a. Run powershell (click the start icon, scroll to "Windows PowerShell", click the "Windows PowerShell" folder, click the "Windows PowerShell" application)

1b. In the PowerShell console that opens, type:

Set-Executionpolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

..and hit the "Enter" key. You'll get a warning asking you if you're sure you want to do this. Type 'y' and hit "Enter".

2. Install the attached powershell-shortcut as a startup item.
2a. Save the attached start-exp.ps1 file to the Documents folder on the laptop.
2b. Save the attached powershell-shortcut file to the C:\Users\HRVT_7\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup folder on the laptop. (Note that you may need to replace HRVT_7 with the correct user name - I'm not sure if all of the participant laptops are using the same user name or not.)
2c. Restart the laptop to make sure that TianTian's application runs.

Once you’ve downloaded it and unlocked it, right-click on it and choose “Run with PowerShell” to test it out. That should run emWave, run Tiantian’s app, and hide emWave. If it doesn’t do that, let me know how it’s failing and I’ll see if I can figure out what’s going wrong.
